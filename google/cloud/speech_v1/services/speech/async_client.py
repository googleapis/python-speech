                      has a high stability and is less likely to change;
                      the second portion has a low stability and is very
                      likely to change. A UI designer might choose to
                      show only high stability results.
                   -  The specific stability and confidence values shown
                      above are only for illustrative purposes. Actual
                      values may vary.
