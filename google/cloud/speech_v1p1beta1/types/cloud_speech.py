            ``RecognitionAudio`` messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000.
            16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of
            the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use

            LINEAR16 and FLAC are ``1``-``8``. Valid values for OGG_OPUS

            on each channel set
            ``enable_separate_recognition_per_channel`` to 'true'.
        enable_separate_recognition_per_channel (bool):
            This needs to be set to ``true`` explicitly and
            ``audio_channel_count`` > 1 to get each channel recognized
            separately. The recognition result will contain a

            belongs to. If this is not true, we will only recognize the

            channels recognized: ``audio_channel_count`` multiplied by
            the length of the audio.
        language_code (str):
            Required. The language of the supplied audio as a

            `BCP-47 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt>`__

        max_alternatives (int):
            Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned.
            Specifically, the maximum number of
            ``SpeechRecognitionAlternative`` messages within each
            ``SpeechRecognitionResult``. The server may return fewer
            than ``max_alternatives``. Valid values are ``0``-``30``. A

        profanity_filter (bool):
            If set to ``true``, the server will attempt to filter out
            profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each
            filtered word with asterisks, e.g. "f***". If set to
            ``false`` or omitted, profanities won't be filtered out.
        adaptation (~.resource.SpeechAdaptation):
            Speech adaptation configuration improves the accuracy of

            If ``true``, the top result includes a list of words and the
            start and end time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If
            ``false``, no word-level time offset information is
            returned. The default is ``false``.
        enable_word_confidence (bool):
            If ``true``, the top result includes a list of words and the
            confidence for those words. If ``false``, no word-level
            confidence information is returned. The default is
            ``false``.
        enable_automatic_punctuation (bool):
            If 'true', adds punctuation to recognition
            result hypotheses. This feature is only
            available in select languages. Setting this for
            requests in other languages has no effect at
            all. The default 'false' value does not add
            punctuation to result hypotheses.
        enable_speaker_diarization (bool):
            If 'true', enables speaker detection for each recognized
            word in the top alternative of the recognition result using
            a speaker_tag provided in the WordInfo. Note: Use
            diarization_config instead.
        diarization_speaker_count (int):
            If set, specifies the estimated number of speakers in the
            conversation. Defaults to '2'. Ignored unless
            enable_speaker_diarization is set to true. Note: Use
            diarization_config instead.
        diarization_config (~.cloud_speech.SpeakerDiarizationConfig):
            Config to enable speaker diarization and set
            additional parameters to make diarization better
            suited for your application. Note: When this is
            enabled, we send all the words from the
            beginning of the audio for the top alternative
            in every consecutive STREAMING responses. This
            is done in order to improve our speaker tags as
            our models learn to identify the speakers in the
            conversation over time. For non-streaming
            requests, the diarization results will be
            provided only in the top alternative of the
            FINAL SpeechRecognitionResult.
        metadata (~.cloud_speech.RecognitionMetadata):
            Metadata regarding this request.
        model (str):
            Which model to select for the given request. Select the
            model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a
            model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a
            model based on the parameters in the RecognitionConfig.

            A list of strings containing words and phrases "hints" so
            that the speech recognition is more likely to recognize
            them. This can be used to improve the accuracy for specific
            words and phrases, for example, if specific commands are

            List items can also be set to classes for groups of words

            language. For example, rather than providing phrase hints

            months.

            chance of false positive recognition as well. Negative boost
            values would correspond to anti-biasing. Anti-biasing is not
